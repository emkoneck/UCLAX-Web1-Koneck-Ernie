        text: '<p>Parker`s music is heavily influenced by psychedelic rock from the late 1960s and early 1970s. He has stated he has a "fetish for extremely sugary pop music" from the likes of Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue. He sometimes balances the two with combinations of loud guitars and strong, but ethereal melodies. Since the 2015 release of <b>Currents</b>, he has also been strongly influenced by electronic music. </p>',

        text: '<p>Parker makes the music for Tame Impala by himself in the studio. He layers instruments, vocals and effects into a <b>"symphony of sound"</b>. He often incorporates effects like reverb, fuzz, phasing and delay, sometimes in unexpected ways. He experiments a lot with equipment to create new and unique sounds. It is only after the music has been recorded that he assembles the touring band to play live.</p>',
